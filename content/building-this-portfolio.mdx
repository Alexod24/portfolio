Building a portfolio is more than just showcasing work; it's about creating an experience that reflects your personality and technical skills. For this version of my portfolio, I decided to go all-in with **Next.js 14**, **Tailwind CSS**, and **MagicUI**.

## The Tech Stack

I chose this stack for several reasons:

1.  **Performance**: Next.js provides excellent performance out of the box with server-side rendering and static site generation.
2.  **Design Freedom**: Tailwind CSS allowed me to rapidly prototype and style components without fighting against a framework.
3.  **Visual Spark**: MagicUI provided those beautiful, subtle animations that make the site feel "alive".

## Challenges faced

One of the main challenges was integrating the blog system. I wanted to write posts in **MDX** so I could embed React components directly into my articles. This allows for interactive demos and a richer reading experience.

```tsx
// A sneak peek at the MDX setup
export function BlogLayout({ children }) {
  return (
    <article className="prose dark:prose-invert mx-auto">
      {children}
    </article>
  )
}
```

## Future Plans

I plan to add more interactive elements, perhaps a guestbook or a "now" page to share what I'm currently up to. Stay tuned!
